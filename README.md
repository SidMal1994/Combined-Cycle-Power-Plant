# Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant

This dataset is from UCI repository and the aim to predit the Energy Output(Target Output) when the plant is working in full capacity.

In the notebook I have predited the Energy output using Linear Regression, where the steps involved were as follows:
 -Performing EDA using histogram, correlation matrix.
 
 -Cleaning the data
 -Model Development
 -Prediction & Accuracy check.
 
 Note: Though this dataset is small and there are outliers but the mean values for all the features were lying in b/w of the distribution, but I tried to predit the output variable with and without outlier.
 
 -In CCPP-Copy-1 prediction is done after treating outliers and
 -CCPP file has prediction without outlier treatment.
